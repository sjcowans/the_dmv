# The DMV

This is the starter repo for the BE Mod1 DMV project.

1. Describe the steps you took to dig in to this code base. What was your process? If you don’t feel you had a process, define one that you might like to try next time.

I accidentally started the project from scratch early so when I first looked at the database I actually understood what each piece was trying to do fairly quickly since it looked very similar to what I wrote. I think in the future I would take a similar approach but use thoughts/ideas rather than actual code (to speed up the process) to see how I'd do it before looking at the pre-existing code. This way I am taking the programs theoretical intent and trying to rationalize it before seeing the implemented idea to help better understand the implemented idea's functioning.

2. What was hard about working with code you did not write?

The hardest part is syntax. Sometimes it takes a while to understand what the line or two that is written differently from what I have seen is actually doing so I have to play with it first. This can eat up a lot of time depending on my familiarity.

3. What was easier than you expected about jumping in to an unfamiliar codebase? What made it easy? If nothing felt easy, what would’ve helped you feel more comfortable more quickly?

The biggest thing was it felt much easier to get started. When I started from scratch I had to go through the initial thinking and planning so when I saw the pre-existing stuff it greatly expedited my second go of it. It also (I think) helped me clean up the code a little.
